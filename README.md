## Professional Self-Assessment
Throughout this program, completing coursework and developing my ePortfolio has helped me deepen my understanding of key concepts while allowing me to showcase real-world applications of those skills. Creating an ePortfolio offers potential employers to view my previous work and see what I could contribute to the industry.

One important part of the program was learning to collaborate effectively in team environments. Throughout multiple courses, I was able to develop skills that are essential for being successful in diverse technical teams. This includes critical thinking, effective communication, and leadership skills as well as learning about project management and agile frameworks.

Effective communication with stakeholders was another critical skill developed during my time in the program. In courses like Systems Analysis and Design, I learned to effectively communicate technical concepts and design decisions to various audiences in a professional manner. Practicing this helped me get better at presenting, tailoring my language and approach depending on the stakeholderâ€™s background. 

My foundation in data structures and algorithms was strengthened through problem-solving in courses like Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design. I was able to implement and analyze structures such as trees, graphs, and hash tables, and learned to optimize algorithmic efficiency. 

In software engineering and database coursework, I gained experience in full-stack development, database design, and SQL. In my Introduction to Structured Database Environments course, I learned about basic processing functionality and best practices for data management, data manipulation, and data analysis. In addition, I constructed and analyzed queries to address data requirements. In my Full-Stack Development class, I designed and developed a full stack application through the utilization of programming language frameworks. The projects from both these courses deepened my understanding of both client-server architecture and the software development lifecycle.

Security also played a significant role in my education. In the Software Security course, I learned how to develop secure code that complies with security testing protocols. In addition to exploring and implementing security concepts through code, I learned why and how to apply encryption technologies and techniques to communicate securely. I became more aware of common vulnerabilities and learned how to defend against them.

My ePortfolio focuses on enhancements made to a text-based game I created in a previous course. This artifact was chosen because it was a project I completed at the beginning of my computer science education, so it provided a good opportunity to showcase my growth and improvement. It specifically will demonstrate my knowledge of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.


## Original Artifact - projectPractice.py
The artifact I have made enhancements to is a harry potter text-based adventure game. Players are able to navigate between different rooms in Hogwarts to collect items (Horcruxes) to defeat Voldemort. This artifact was created as a project in IT140. 

## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering
To improve the original text-based game, I converted it into a web application by building a Flask API with JavaScript-powered UI. The improved UI includes Bootstrap styling, buttons, game updates, and instructions. This makes the game accessible, visually appealing, and engaging for players.
	
	
## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure
To enhance the artifact, I implemented a graph for room navigation. I represented the map of Hogwarts using a graph where rooms are nodes and paths are edges. I used Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path between rooms. I implemented this into game play by providing a hint button for the player to show the shortest path the finish. I also used a hash map for inventory management. This ensures efficient item handling and scalability.

## Enhancement Three: Databases
To enhance the artifact, I integrated a database to store game history with MySQL. The player enters their name and starts the game, after they are finished, their win or loss is recorded allowing them to track progress over multiple sessions.
